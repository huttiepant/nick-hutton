# Example Article Title

This is an example article showing you how to write in Markdown. It's much simpler than HTML!

## This is a subtitle (h3 in your HTML)

Just write your paragraphs normally. No need for `<p>` tags - they'll be added automatically.

You can make text **bold** or *italic* easily.

### Smaller heading (h4)

You can also create lists:

- Create bullet lists
- Like this
- Super simple

Or numbered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Another subtitle

Add [links](https://example.com) easily.

> You can even add block quotes if you want.

Just write naturally and the converter will handle the rest!
