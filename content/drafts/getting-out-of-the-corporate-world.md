# The corporate world is absolutely not all bad

You have a pretty handy pay packet, and don’t have that much accountability. Yes, you can get in trouble (sometimes deep trouble) from your boss, and it will feel like your world is imploding – but the business will still go on, and the share price won’t move.

(Note: If an error you’ve made does affect the share price of your multinational business, you’re far more senior than people I ever dealt with…or you’ve made one hell of a fuck-up.)

## There were just things that weren’t for me

Given we’re going to be required to work for 40+ years of our lives, I just felt that I should search for more than I was getting. The things that bothered me:

- Requiring ten layers of management to approve an idea you have;
- The sign of being important is to make sure you have a calendar full of meetings. If you ever get to use the phrase “sorry, can we push it to next Tuesday?” then you know you’ve made it;
- The single best way to get ahead is to look busy and always tell people just how busy you are. George Costanza was smarter than we thought;
- The empty feeling of being a tiny wheel in a large cog. A friend of mine went to the movies at 10:30am one day, and decided not to go back to work. The next day his boss had no idea he wasn’t in the office;
- I watched *The Inside Job* about 20 times, and while I don’t want to make generalisations here, a lot of bankers aren't in the role to make society a better place;
- The corporate structure doesn’t exactly lead to the ‘one team, one dream’ type attitude from most people.

## Too idealistic?

Simply put, I wanted to be involved in something where you could see a direct and positive impact on the world. If you work harder, more efficiently and smarter, you’ll see the reward within your business, and your business will have a direct, and real impact on society.

I wanted a place that felt like a sports team when you get to work, you work hard and for each other towards a common goal. A place where you could work through the night if you wanted to, and sleep in the next morning. Then you celebrate your successes.

Maybe it's too idealistic, and I didn’t know where I’d find it, but I knew it wouldn’t be at the bank. So finally, it was into the bin for the baggy suit.
