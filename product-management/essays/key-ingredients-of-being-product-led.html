                <h1>Key ingredients to being a product-led organisation</h1>
                    <p>It’s always very easy to look at companies operating poorly day-to-day and complain about how things are run. It’s much harder to do it in real life, clearly. However, being a product-led, innovative business is something that I think all companies should aspire to. This is a list of some of the key players and what I believe they can do to ensure the business operates in this way.</p>
                    <p>This is written from a product managers perspective and comes from the view of what an organisation can do to ensure a PM does their best possible work.</p>
                    <p>*I think building an amazing culture another integral part in ensuring your company has the best chance for success, and there is overlap in this area - being product-led means encouraging failure and learning from it as an example, which is an essential cultural trait for the org. My thinking in culture isn’t as clearly defined currently so this will focus on what can be done to be product-led.</p>
                <h2>Key highlights of being product-led</h2>
                    <li>The company must be focused on the long-term to a crazy extent;</li>
                    <li>Everything needs to be built around solving customer problems;</li>
                    <li>Extreme focus on a small number of business challenges;</li>
                    <li>All employees really need to be tasked with solving outcomes, rather than focus on outputs;</li>
                    <li>Failing can be a great thing and must be encourages, so long as you learn from it. The speed of learning is of paramount importance;</li>
                    <li>Dealing with unstructured problems is the key to success, as your innovation depends on discovering (and solving) unknown unknowns;</li>
                    <p>How you encourage these behaviours business-wide is beyond the scope of this article, but will be something I document in the future.</p>
                <h2>How does each role contribute to this?</h2>
                <h3>Founder / GM / CEO</h3>
                    <p>The two main areas of focus for this role to set the business up to be product-led are (1) to define the vision, and ensure that the points in ‘key highlights’ are acted out in every decision throughout the organisation; and (2) to create and clearly articulate the strategy of how the business will achieve its vision.</p>
                    <p>To this point, these are the main outputs I look for from this role:</p>
                    <li>A clear definition of the vision of the business and what they see the world looking like in 15 years;</li>
                    <li>An explicit definition of the customer and what problems they have;</li>
                    <li>An understanding of how to behave in any situation (this isn’t really an output, it’s a general feeling that is communicated through the business - it’s really covered in the culture);</li>
                    <li>2-3 strategy points that the business is focused on at that time.</li>
                <h4>A note on strategy</h4>
                    <p>Having 2-3 strategy points sounds easy, it’s not. The biggest mistake I know of is having 10 strategy points wrapped in vague (but big) MBA-type language. Often, it’s a ‘strategy’ like increase revenue. Strategy is how you achieve your goals - not your goals - and it needs to guide what the rest of the organisation works on. If you’re not strategic, you’ll be reactive.</p>
                    <p>Think of business strategy as a soccer game. Most strategies involve the equivalent of “let’s score more goals than the opposition.” A good strategy though determines your biggest strengths, your weaknesses, your oppositions strengths and weaknesses, the conditions on the day and many other factors to increase your likelihood of winning.</p>
                <h4>Traits of someone in this role that are useful</h4>
                    <li>Clear communicator;</li>
                    <li>Incredible knowledge of the industry, including the history and trends;</li>
                    <li>Hard worker;</li>
                    <li>Technically amazing, but a big-picture thinker.</li>
                <h4>Reading list</h4>
                    <li>Good Strategy / Bad Strategy</li>
                    <li>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</li>
                    <li>7 Powers</li>
                <h3>CPO / Head of Product</h3>
                    <p>This role needs to not only have incredible knowledge of the business itself, the market and the industry, but they need to be extremely strong in understanding product across industries.</p>
                    <p>I don’t believe PMs are looking up to this person for their incredible technical knowledge of the product, and frequently, PMs may be able to show things in the product that this person hasn’t seen before.</p>
                    <p>However, they must be able to clearly and masterfully communicate a product’s vision. This vision must make it clear to the rest of the product group what outcomes they’re all trying to achieve, and what problems are most important to the business to solve (these must inevitably solve the customers’ problems).</p>
                    <p>It’s vital for this role to communicate the outcomes that are needed to be achieved, so that the teams below feel empowered to achieve this outcome however they see fit. They should be working with the VP of Product and the PMs to challenge the goals and team strategies that are being set (they shouldn’t set them, the should have a very open door when it comes to discussing them though).</p>
                    <p>This role needs to set product principles, a strong product vision and a coherent product strategy that is ruthlessly prioritised around a few key goals. Without this, you end up with an organisation that is built around optimising components rather than the whole.</p>
                    <p>On the culture side, this role must follow the lead of the CEO and ensure that the product team feel comfortable taking risks and failing. One way to do this is to encourage everyone to think of their work in terms of bets.</p>
                    <p>Outputs I’m looking for from this role:</p>
                    <li>Clear and concise product vision and product principles;</li>
                    <li>Strategic focus for the business and the product over the next year.</li>
                    <p>The questions this role should be answering and filtering down to the teams are:</p>
                    <li>How do all our products work together to provide value (and make sense) to our customers?</li>
                    <li>What guidelines and principles should the individual teams be following when building new products?</li>
                    <li>Does it all make sense from a business and product strategy point of view?</li>
                <h4>Reading list</h4>
                    <li>Empowered;</li>
                    <li>Escaping The Build Trap;</li>
                    <li>No Rules Rules;</li>
                    <li>Competing against luck.</li>
                <h3>Director of Product / VP of Product</h3>
                    <p>A VP of Product may have 10 or more PMs reporting to them, and their role differs from an individual contributor (IC - a PM or Senior PM) because there is a lot of people management in the role. They will also be on the hook for more strategic level thinking than an IC.</p>
                    <p>So a great VP of Product will have good experience as a PM and maybe even a Senior PM, but the role will be very different.</p>
                    <p>In this product-led company, the VP of Product must also be a champion of the outcome approach, and be careful to never praise or reward a PM getting excited about an output (a big project they’ve committed to for example).</p>
                    <p>So they must be a mentor for the PMs underneath them, and be able to offer assistance on a large number of issues they may be having (”how do I best test this idea quickly?” “why don’t you try this wizard of oz test”). While they can’t hide from the business strategy, the market and what the key areas of focus for the product are they also need to be amazing managers. This includes being well aware of their staffs motivations and emotions.</p>
                    <p>For a start, the best people typically want these things:</p>>
                    <li>An opportunity for huge impact + personal growth;</li>
                    <li>To work with other great people;</li>
                    <li>To be compensated well (this role must be aware of the market rates and adjust if necessary);</li>
                    <li>No bullshit (politics or red tape).</li>
                    <p>The VP’s job is to detect if this environment is being set. If it’s not, they must act quickly to fix it. Good people will frequently leave before they raise their deepest concerns.</p>
                <h3>What does a PM need in a product led organisation?</h3>
                    <p>If as an organisation, you don’t do all of the above, it’s going to be very difficult to get the most out of your PMs. The best ones will probably try and do some of the above, but get confused while doing so and not focus on their core job. And the bad ones will probably have some process they can follow where they shift tickets in the backlog all day long, and call a bunch of group meetings.</p>
                    <p>But let’s assume this is all set up nicely, the PMs will have a clear understanding of their role and how they can contribute to the business growing (which is surely what everyone wants). The other things you’ll need to setup as a product-led organisation for the PMs is:</p>
                    <li>Direct access to customers;</li>
                    <li>Direct access to engineers;</li>
                    <li>Direct access to stakeholders.</li>
                    <p>The PM is now set up for success. To reach a high level, the PM needs to work quickly and focus on becoming an expert in a number of areas - the product (you don’t need to understand and solve every bug that comes in, but still have a deep knowledge of how it’s used), the customer and the market. </p>
                    <p>On top of this, the PM needs exceptional relationship building skills because they need to be inspiring their team of devs and designer, while managing all stakeholders from the marketing team to the head of sales and anyone in between.</p>
                    <p>A PM could work for 100 hours a week and still have more to do, so it’s essential that they remain focused on the key areas for that point in time. In general though, they should be thinking about possible solutions, getting these into customers’ hands and iterating far more than the customer problem (the customer problem is the most important thing by far, but it shouldn’t require 100% of a PM’s time to uncover it).</p>
                    <p>The product-led organisation must help PMs by understanding that it’s an unstructured problem they’re working on, and give them space to think. A great product-led organisation will constantly help them in improving their ability of how to think.</p>

                <h2>Structure of the teams</h2>
                    <p>One of the easiest things to get right, but a common problem for mediocre tech companies. Some teams I’ve seen focus on either a specific technical component (ie. the checkout) which can lead to doing work when there’s no work to be done. Other focus on features of a product - which leads to the dreaded ‘output focus’ rather than ‘outcome focus,’ and in the long-term, assures a lack of cross-product knowledge throughout the organisation.</p>
                    <p>Teams must be structured around the business’s strategic goals, or around the key value streams of the business.</p>
                <h3>Processes</h3>
                    <p>Building a product is an inherently unstructured problem to solve, and therefore, I think trying to implement processes to govern the entire situation is moronic. Some frameworks that are commonly used include kanban, scrum, SAFe (🤢 ) etc. </p>
                    <p>It’s incredibly easy to criticise these but this article is about how I’d fix things, so I’ll refrain.</p>
                    <p>Generally, in a product-led organisation, I believe each team should have the autonomy to operate however they want. I’d strongly recommend never ever use SAFe or a strict-scrum though. Parts of scrum and kanban can work to an extent but don’t be tied to a one-size fits all method. As per any innovative culture, your team should test some options and iterate to see what works best.</p>
                    <p>I’d suggest using a plan > build (iterate) > ship methodology and create an extremely open environment for discussion about work processes. If something isn’t working, discuss it openly and be very open to changing immediately.</p>
                <h4>Who should manage a project then?</h4>
                    <li>For a team level project, having engineers collaborate directly is far more beneficial than having the engineers talk to a project manager who talks to another project manager who talks to a developer. This direct collaboration is much better for so many obvious reasons - but we know they’ll both be trying to minimise processes, and that’s got to be a good thing for unstructured problems.</li>
                    <li>For gigantic projects spanning multiple teams, there should be a technical program manager who is a developer and they are their own role that spans across multiple teams.</li>
                <h3>Metrics</h3>
                    <p>This is a non-negotiable. Any product-led company must have a good pipeline setup for tracking engagement and metrics of users. While you can’t rely solely on data to operate as a PM, you also can’t operate with any sort of confidence without it.</p>
                <h3>Meetings</h3>
                    <p>I would sit on the side of no meetings if there was a debate of traditional meeting structure vs no meetings at all.  It’s not that I’m strictly anti-meeting, it’s that I’m strictly against pointless meetings - and I find most meetings pointless. </p>
                    <p>The thing that a lot of people don’t get with meetings is that it’s not just the meeting time, it’s the 30 minutes before and after when you are context switching, or deciding that you can’t jump into an important piece of work because 30 minutes is not enough time to focus.</p>
                    <p>If you need to call a meeting, I like the Amazon style of locking away an hour. The person calling the meeting must prepare a document for people to read in the first 15-20 minutes, and then comments can happen in the 40 minutes after.</p>
                    <p>In terms of understanding what your team is working on and if they need any knowledge sharing (i.e. what people often think standup is for), well that can be done simply via a message on the team Slack channel with the predicament and a follow-up call with the relevant person when they have time.</p>
                    <p>One meeting I would set up on a recurring basis (weekly) is a sharing and learning session, where each team member can share something they’ve learned that week. Each person has 10 minutes to present anything they want and open up discussion.</p>
                    <p>This is another area that crosses into the culture environment, but in general, I believe greatly in knowledge sharing and collaboration. I don’t believe in daily / weekly recurring meetings because ‘that’s what you do.’</p>
                <h3>Roadmap</h3>
                    <p>An area that frightens most people. A lot of people in output-focused businesses are desperate for a roadmap for the next year to see what will be worked on and to justify everyone’s existence within the organisation. A PM with an outcome focus will be terrified of having so many outputs listed that people can pick apart when they don’t happen (which they inevitably will).</p>
                    <p>My solution is to have outcome-focused roadmaps over the year (ie. improve the conversion rate over the year by 10%) and within your team as a PM, produce a ‘roadmapping’ document. This is a live document that outlines the mission > vision > strategy and goals (outcomes) of the team. It will also include plans for the next few quarters, which may be changed as conditions change. I used to be against this, but I now see it’s vital to have some structure for the team to remain focused.</p>
                <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>Similar thoughts on planning - it scares a lot of PMs (myself included) because of how poorly it can be done. Planning is inherently rigid, yet we’re supposed to solve unstructured problems - it doesn’t seem to make sense. </p>
                    <p>But when done correctly, planning is essential for leadership to have an understanding of what is being done to attack the company’s biggest problems, as well as keeping the team aligned and motivated when things get tough.</p>
                    <p>To do planning well is difficult, but this article is the best I’ve found to help all people involved: </p>
