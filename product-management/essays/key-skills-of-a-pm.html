                <h1>Key skills of a PM</h1>
                <p>If you’re fortunate enough to have been set up with a product-led organisation as described in my previous article "key ingredients of being product-led," you’re now ready to have a significant impact on the world via your product. </p>
                <p>The good news is being a great Product Manager (PM) can lead you to be the most popular person in the organisation - Customer Support will love you because you’ve answer the customers’ questions before they get to them, Sales and Marketing will love you because you’ve made their jobs 10x easier and the CEO will love you because you’ve made him richer. Unfortunately, the opposite is true.</p>
                <p>As is spoken about on just about every PM blog on the internet, there are an interminable amount of skills needed to succeed in the role. However, these are some of the highest leverage skills that I think you can hone in on to flourish as a PM.</p>
                <h2>Be a ridiculously good interviewer</h2>
                <p>‘Interviewer’ may be the wrong word. But you need to be extremely good at conversing with customers and non-customers alike about your product and the market. These conversations can happen online, scheduled in person (or video call) or unplanned in person.</p>
                <p>Not having these skills is akin to a batsman in cricket not having a solid defence - you’ll certainly have a chance to look good in the lower grades, but you’ll get found out very quickly at the top.</p>
                <p>Just about every book on building a product has a section to do with interviewing customers, but I think none do it better in whole than The Mom Test. If I could summarise quickly: ditch the discussion guide, talk about previous experiences, let them do most of the talking and ask ‘why’ a lot.</p>
                <h2>Learn rapidly</h2>
                <p>Product managing involves being an expert on your own product, competitors, the business and the market. This takes time. So a way to get ahead is to increase the speed of your learning loop 10x.</p>
                <p>This learning is also important on a more micro level when you’re speaking to customers, showing prototypes and getting direct feedback in other ways. </p>
                <p>The quicker you learn about the market dynamics and your customers, the quicker you can come up with solutions. The quicker you get solutions in the hands of people to give you feedback, the quicker you learn what you need to improve and this cycle continues. You’ll never get the solution right first time, but the if you learn rapidly along the way, it won’t matter at all.</p>
                <p>This tweet sums it up nicely:</p>
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/levie/status/1581435416904728576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fnickhutton%2FKey-skills-of-a-PM-517384e625114ce5bda9379e88a69eed">Aaron Levie tweet</a></p>
                <h2>Be modest, assured and opinionated at the same time</h2>
                <p>What a phenomenal contradiction of a request, but it’s true. You need to have strong views on the market, the product and trends. You also need to be humble enough to change your mind at the drop of a hat. A majority of people are too proud to do this, and they are the ones that can’t succeed in this role.</p>
                <p>Imagine you uncover some new information about an idea for a product change you’ve been campaigning around the office for months, and it makes it untenable. Will you have the modesty, yet confidence to be telling everyone that this idea is no longer the solution and at this stage, you don’t know what is?</p>
                <h2>Be great at discovering information</h2>
                <p>An underrated skill in life these days is the ability to research topics in depth at great speed. This holds particularly true as a product manager. If you’re in a product-led company, you will have been given an outcome that you need to achieve with no definitive help from anyone. Yes, you’ll be able to pick the brains of anyone in your business, but you’ll be driving those conversations - so don’t go in without having done your research. </p>
                <h2>Be comfortable handling unstructured situations</h2>
                <p>Being a Product Manager is like being part of a race where you’re given the finish line, and you just need to get there in the quickest way possible. You could fly but they only leave on the hour, you could drive but will the traffic hurt you, there’s an electric bike shop around the corner etc.</p>
                <p>There is no ‘right’ answer, and you need to be comfortable with making decisions in that situation. You also need to have ways to improve your chances of succeeding when there is not one correct answer (see Learn Rapidly above). </p>
                <h2>Be able to apply structure when it’s beneficial</h2>
                <p>Of course dealing with unstructured situations doesn’t mean throwing spaghetti at the wall every morning and hoping it sticks. There are frameworks and techniques you can (and should) use for many of the steps in getting to the outcome you need. But what you use, how and where is completely up to you.</p>
                <h2>Be prepared to come up with solutions and be creative</h2>
                <p>Speaking of solutions, you’ll need to spend a lot of your time coming up with solutions. Strangely this is contrary to a lot of opinion out there.</p>
                <p>Yes, discovering the customer problem is the main focus early on in your time with the product. But in reality, you’ll learn the customer’s problem quite quickly and can keep in touch with it by spending 10% of your week on it. The hard part is solving this problem and you’ll need to think creatively about plenty of possible solutions.</p>
                <p>And on the topic of creativity, a PM doesn’t need to be a professional abstract artist, but being able to stretch the creativity muscle will take you a long way.</p>
                <h3>Handy hint</h3>
                <p>If you can think of the solutions you come up with bets, your mind will be in the right place. The best form of this I’ve heard of is Spotify who think in terms of DIBBs - data, insights, beliefs that inform bets.</p>
                <h2>Be able to build relationships with people of all levels within the company</h2>
                <p>You won’t have anyone reporting to you, but you’re expected to improve the most important thing in any business - the product. To be successful, you need to understand how everyone in the business fits in and see the business from their eyes. You’ll also want everyone in the business to know who you are and what you’re doing. By doing this, you’ll get any relevant information that needs to come your way.</p>
                <p>You also need to earn the respect of everyone in the business. You need engineers and designers to do work to bring your vision to life, and you’ll need marketing and sales to ensure it’s distributed as you want - to name just a few parts of the business. </p>
                <p>The best way you can do this is by being very open and clear about what you’re doing and why. </p>
                <h2>Be open and clear about what you’re doing</h2>
                <p>Clarity of your vision and why you’re doing things is essential to the broader business. You’ll need to convey how you’re making the product better so that people remember your two sentences in a meeting filled with other sentences.</p>
                <p>And you’ll need to be so open with what you’re doing that you get sick and tired of explaining what you’re doing. Only then will the message start getting through.</p>
                <h2>Learn computer science</h2>
                <p>I actually believe that everyone should learn how to code because it is a rigour that helps your thinking more than anything I’ve found. But if you’re working with engineers on a software product, it’s fair to say it will be beneficial to know approximately how it works. There are plenty of examples of wildly successful people in product who aren’t technical, this is just my opinion.</p>
                <p>As I explained at the start, there are many more traits and tactics that can help you succeed in the PM role at a great company, but there should hold you in good stead.</p>
