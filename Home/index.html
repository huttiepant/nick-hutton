        <h2>Invariably Unstructured</h2>
        <p> My name is Nick. I think the world is an unstructured place and we spend too much time trying to place things in buckets, rather than learning how to deal with and exploit the disordered nature of the world.</p>
        <p> This is not to diminish the fact that structure can provide help. Applying the right processes are still a necessity for success. However, as a society, we focus far too greatly on these structures, and as a result miss the opportunity to handle the uncertainty and the beauty it can bring.</p>
        <p> This blog will have some structure to assist in reading, but as is the way in the world, it will invariably be unstructured.</p>
